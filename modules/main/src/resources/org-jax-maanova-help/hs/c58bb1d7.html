<h1>Interacting With the R Terminal</h1>

<p>The built-in R terminal allows a basic level of interaction with the R environment without leaving the R/maanova application.</p>

<h2>R Status</h2>

<p>Many of the graphical interfaces that you can use in J/maanova are just front ends to R commands (Eg: see <a href="08181793.html">Loading Tab-Delimited Data</a>). These interfaces will show you a preview of the R command being built. When you "OK" your settings you will see the command printed to the R terminal at the bottom of the screen in blue text along with any resulting R output in black text. If the command entered is a long-running task (such as a test with permutations) the status bar will read "<tt><b>Evaluating R Command</b></tt>" until the command completes.</p>
<h2>Entering R Commands</h2>

<p>The <tt><b>Insert Comment or Command...</b></tt> button can be used to execute user supplied R commands. This command should be used with caution since it is possible to enter commands which will delete or corrupt data objects in your workspace. Also note that if you use a plot command you must render to a file based graphics device (such as <tt><b>png(...)</b></tt>) rather than the default device. Rendering to the default device will cause errors. See <tt><b>http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#Multiple-graphics-devices</b></tt> for introductory documentation on using graphics devices.</p>
