<h1>Exporting R Data</h1>

<p>You can use the <tt><b>File-&gt;Export R Data...</b></tt> menu item to save your projects current R state. Once this file is saved you can load it directly into the R command line environment using the <tt><b>load(file)</b></tt> function. After running the load function you can use the <tt><b>objects()</b></tt> function to see all of the R objects that were created by J/maanova.</p>
