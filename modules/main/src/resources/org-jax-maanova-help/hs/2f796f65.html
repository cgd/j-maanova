<h1>Plot Residuals vs. Estimates</h1>

<p>After <a href="9bb7e965.html">fitting a model</a> you can create a scatter plot of the residuals against the estimated values (Y Hat). You can open this graph by right-clicking a fit node in your project's data tree and selecting <b><tt>Show Residual Plot</tt></b> or by selecting one of the <tt><b>Analysis-&gt;Plot Residuals vs. Estimates-&gt;...</b></tt> menu items from J/maanova's main menu.</p>

<p>After creating the graph you can mouse over any of the data points to see a popup window containing more detailed information. See the <a href="5adb6e94.html">general graph settings</a> for help on saving graph images, zooming in and out and changing graph labels.</p>
