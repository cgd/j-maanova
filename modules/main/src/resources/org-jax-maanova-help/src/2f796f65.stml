:title Plot Residuals vs. Estimates
:label residual-plot

After <<fit-anova|fitting a model>> you can create a scatter plot of the residuals against the estimated values (Y Hat). You can open this graph by right-clicking a fit node in your project's data tree and selecting **::Show Residual Plot::** or by selecting one of the ::**Analysis->Plot Residuals vs. Estimates->...**:: menu items from J/maanova's main menu.

After creating the graph you can mouse over any of the data points to see a popup window containing more detailed information. See the <<graphs|general graph settings>> for help on saving graph images, zooming in and out and changing graph labels.
