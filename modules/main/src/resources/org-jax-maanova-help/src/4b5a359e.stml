You can use the ::**File->Export R Data...**:: menu item to save your projects current R state. Once this file is saved you can load it directly into the R command line environment using the ::**load(file)**:: function. After running the load function you can use the ::**objects()**:: function to see all of the R objects that were created by J/maanova.
