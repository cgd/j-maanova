After loading <<load-tab-data|tab data>> or <<load-affy-data|affymetrix data>> you can do array vs. array intensity scatter plots (for two-dye experiments you can plot any array/dye combination against any other array/dye combination). You can open an array intensity scatter plot by right clicking an array node in your project's data tree and selecting ::**Scatter Plot Array Intensities**:: or by selecting ::**Analysis->Plot Array Intensities->...**:: from the main menu.

After creating the graph you can mouse over any of the data points to see a popup window containing more detailed information. See the <<graphs|general graph settings>> for help on saving graph images, zooming in and out and changing graph labels.
