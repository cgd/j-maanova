<h1>Graphs</h1>

<p>This section contains information about the different graphs that you can plot with J/maanova. Note that all references to menu items in this help document refer to the graph's menu bar rather than the top-level J/maanova menu bar.</p>
<h2>General Graph Settings</h2>

<p>There are several settings that you can use which are common to most of the graphs you will use with J/maanova.</p>
<h3>Saving a Graph Image</h3>

<p>Use <tt><b>File&rarr;Save Graph as Image...</b></tt> to save the graph to a PNG file. PNG is a lossless bitmap format so the rendered result should exactly match the graph that you see on your screen. This means that if you want a higher resolution graph image you can resize the graph window to take up more space.</p>
<h3>Customizing Graph Labels</h3>

<p>You can edit the graph header or axis labels by using the <tt><b>Tools&rarr;Configure Graph...</b></tt> menu item.</p>
<h3>Zooming</h3>

<p>You can zoom in by "rubber-band" selecting an area of the graph to zoom into. To zoom out select <tt><b>Tools&rarr;Zoom Out</b></tt> which will cause the graph to zoom out to its initial size.</p>
